The guard moaned softly before collapsing onto the floor. He wasn't dead, but
when he awoke hours later, he'd have what felt like one hell of a hangover.
That's why Quincy had volunteered as the operation's locksmith. They were one
of the few who could&mdash; and would&mdash; manage [the orders? the task at hand?] without actually killing
anybody. They systematically patted the guard's pockets until finding the needed security key-card [and swiping it along X]. Soon, they would grant their brethren
access and the operation could begin.

Ironic, Quincy thought, rising. A semblance [Is this term familiar enough to RWBY fans? I didn't recall it] that was almost useless for
aspiring huntsmen against Grimm was so incredibly effective against humans.

At the nearby control terminal embedded into hallway wall, they doused the
lights and ran the key-card through the scanner. The adjacent door slid open
with a quiet _hiss_. They moved noiselessly, [back against] the entrance, tasting
the air with a long, forked tongue. Their other senses more than compensated
for relatively sub-par night vision (all the more obscured by their
fanged, red and white Grimm mask). Only traces of Dust powder and machine oil&mdash;
nothing unusual for a Schnee Dust processing plant. They rounded the door,
advancing only a few feet, before...

"Halt! You are trespassing on private Schnee property! Promptly disarm and..."

Damn! Damn damn damn. [The] skeletal silhouettes were just visible via the
faint backlight of various electronics, their smells intertwined with those of
the processing machinery. The Schnees were really upping their security presence
if they were willing to shell out for Atlas security androids. Quincy couldn't
pause for the androids' simultaneous monotone monologues to conclude&mdash;
training told them the androids' rifles would already be raising. They drew
their sword from the sheath on their back and pointed it at the nearest
android.

Lacuna&mdash; Quincy's sword, held in a wood-patterned sheath that hung
magnetized across their back. Modeled after a Han _jian_, its thin,
double-edged blade extended three feet from an ornate but diminutive guard. Its
pommel was a revolver-like barrel and hammer, capped below by ornate loops from
which hung twin celadon tassels. Against the threaded grip lay the hammer's
trigger and trigger-guard[. Around] the trigger, Quincy's index finger
squeezed tightly.

The hammer cocked backwards, the pommel-barrel turned, and the hammer dropped.
In a heartbeat, Lacuna's blade exploded forward, extending in segments across
six, twelve, eighteen feet along thin cable. A shower of sparks indicated that
the android had been hit, but the blue-white glow of [its] still-charging rifle
proved the strike non-[critical? Can an attack to an android be "lethal"?]. Quincy snapped their arm whip-like and released
the trigger[. More] sparks flew, and the entire pommel mechanism spun wildly,
reeling in the collapsible cable, reassembling the sword segments at the hilt.
The two halves of the android's body, sawed cleanly through the middle, hit the
metal floor with resounding _thunks_, [its] unfinished monologue trailing into
silence.

Quincy dropped into a full split as two blue-white concussive bolts narrowly
passed overhead. Such energy weapons took time to recharge between shots, [so 
only] two androids must remain. Sensing motion in their periphery, Quincy exited
the split in a forward tumble, raising their sword arm, firing again. As the
blade segmented, they tugged the hilt horizontally, first to one side, then the
other, and were rewarded by the head of the second android rolling
independently across the floor.

Where was the third? Quincy glanced wildly to each side, standing cautiously.
Nested in this machinery, against machinery, Quincy was practically blind.
Still, security androids weren't exactly renown for stealth. Perhaps they'd
miscounted?

The world went white.

Quincy lay sprawled in a daze against upturned drums, ears ringing, Grimm mask
scattered in pieces across the floor. Under their hands they felt fine,
sand-like grains. Over Quincy towered the final security android, Quincy's
orange eyes reflected in its blank [dark] faceplate, its rifle aimed and
charging. It'd been some time since Quincy had felt a concussive bolt. They
knew [that at this range another] could be lethal.

"[Halt!] You are trespassing on priv..."

In a sheen of arcing electricity and golden sparks, the robot came to an abrupt
and unexpected halt. Quincy let out a deep breath they hadn't realized they'd
been holding.

Aura-siphoning&mdash; Quincy's semblance. Against a human, they could drain an
aura like a cold beer on a mid-summer day. Or, if needed, they could transfer
some back&mdash; [to another person?] so long as they were touching. Which was entirely useless
against beings without auras, such as Grimm or security androids. Unless channeled through Dust. 

Through Dust, an aura acquired some of the
Dust's properties&mdash; which they'd discovered when trying to replenish their
own [Dust?] only to be singed by sudden flames. Judging by the shorted-out robot
standing above Quincy, it must be yellow Dust on which they lay. Quincy's
pinkie finger still rested against the [android's] cold, metal boot.

[Did you mean to make it unclear that Quincy is safe and out of their view for this next scene? If not, a clarifying line would help.]
Roman Torchwick, in his signature white coat and bowler hat, Cinder Fall, in a
scarlet tunic laced with golden dust lines, and dozens of mask-clad White Fang
mulled under an overcast night sky. Numerous Bullhead aircraft backgrounded the
group, their engines tilted and glowing on standby. Occasionally, Torchwick or
another would glance impatiently at the Schnee processing facility's loading
dock, until&mdash; with the hum of mechanical motors and the clinking of
chains&mdash; the array of bay doors all began rising. In a door frame at the
far end leaned Quincy, battered but whole.

["Well, kid,"] started Torchwick in his typically condescending musical tone,
"looks like you had a bit of fun while we were waiting... and waiting. Have a
seat and let the grown-ups take over from here." He turned to address the
others. "Go! Remember, anything not bolted down is ours!" The mass of White
Fang [operatives? agents?] hurried in unison into the building, carts in tow, trucks following
closely behind.

Quincy hissed under their breath. They didn't trust Torchwick farther than
Lacuna could strike. Why were the White Fang working with&mdash; working
_for_&mdash; that disgusting human? How did this possibly advance their cause?
If Quincy's superiors&mdash; and they still trusted them&mdash; had an
explanation, they certainly hadn't proffered it.

Quincy headed towards the loading ramp of the nearest Bullhead, stopping to
assess their reflection in the window of a Schnee cargo truck. Their usually
straight, bistre hair was matted twistedly to their olive skin. Their open,
black Zhongshan jacket and white undershirt were caked with sweat and yellow
dust, obscuring the embroidery they favored. And, of course, their Grimm mask[&mdash;]
the modern symbol of the White Fang&mdash; was missing, destroyed. At least
Lacuna faired well. They'd take time to clean her [gendered weapons? Interesting...] properly while the others
worked, lest the invasive dust cause any undesired effects.

It was some hours later when Quincy was awakened, Lacuna and a polishing cloth
in their lap, by the sound of their returning brethren. A trail of carts and
trucks carried crates of raw Dust crystals, barrels of processed Dust powder,
and a variety of unidentifiable machinery into the various Bullheads. Cinder
shouted, clearly exasperated, directing each load to its appropriate aircraft
while Torchwick paced about impatiently.

Eventually, the loading concluded and the aircraft engines began to whine,
preparing for ascent. Quincy purposely took a seat near the already-buckled
Torchwick and Cinder, hoping to assess their intentions. [Later, Quincy] would
wish they'd chosen any other aircraft. They didn't expect to watch Torchwick
snap his fingers, asking "Would you do the honors?", or to watch Cinder raise
her hands into the air, the Dust lines in her clothing glowing ablaze. Through
the closing cargo ramp, Quincy stared agape as the processing plant, and
everybody they had left inside, evaporated in a blinding fireball.
