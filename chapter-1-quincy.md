The guard moaned softly before collapsing onto the floor. He wasn't dead, but
when he awoke hours later, he'd have what felt like one hell of a hangover.
That's why Quincy had volunteered as the operation's locksmith. They were one
of the few who could- and would- manage without actually killing anybody. They
systematically patted the guard's pockets until finding and swiping the needed
security key-card. Soon, she would grant their brethren access and the
operation could begin.

Ironic, Quincy thought, rising. A semblance that was almost useless for
aspiring huntsmen against Grimm was so incredibly effective against humans.

At the nearby control terminal embedded into hallway wall, they doused the
lights and ran the key-card through the scanner. The adjacent door slid open
with a quiet _hiss_. They moved noiselessly, rear against the entrance, tasting
the air with a long, forked tongue. Their other senses more than compensated
for their relatively sub-par night-vision (all the more obscured by their
fanged, red and white Grimm mask). Only traces of Dust powder and machine oil-
nothing unusual for a Schnee Dust processing plant. They rounded the door,
advancing only a few feet, before...

"Halt! You are trespassing on private Schnee property! Promptly disarm and..."

Damn! Damn damn damn. Their skeletal silhouettes were just visible via the
faint backlight of various electronics, their smells intertwined with those of
the processing machinery. The Schnees were really upping they security presence
if they were willing to shell out for Atlas security androids. Quincy couldn't
pause for the androids' simultaneous monotone monologues to conclude- training
told them the androids' rifles would already be raising. They drew their sword
from the sheath on their back and pointed it at the nearest android.

Lacuna- Quincy's sword, held in a wood-patterned sheath that hung magnetized
across their back. Modeled after a Han _jian_, its thin, double-edged blade
extended three feet from an ornate but diminutive guard. Its pommel was a
revolver-like barrel and hammer, capped below by ornate loops from which hung
twin celadon tassels. Against the threaded grip lay the hammer's trigger and
trigger-guard, and around the trigger, Quincy's index finger squeezed tightly.

The hammer cocked backwards, the pommel-barrel turned, and the hammer dropped.
In a heartbeat, Lacuna's blade exploded forward, extending in segments across
six, twelve, eighteen feet along thin cable. A shower of sparks indicated that
the android had been hit, but the blue-white glow of it's still-charging rifle
proved the strike non-lethal. Quincy snapped her arm whip-like and released the
trigger, more sparks flew, and the entire pommel mechanism spun wildly, reeling
in the collapsible cable, reassembling the sword segments at the hilt. The two
halves of the android's body, sawed cleanly through the middle, hit the metal
floor with resounding _thunks_, it's unfinished monologue trailing into
silence.

Quincy dropped into a full split as two blue-white concussive bolts narrowly
passed overhead. Such energy weapons took time to recharge between shots, so-
only two androids must remain. Sensing motion in her periphery, she exited the
split in a forward tumble, raising her sword arm, firing again. As the blade
segmented, she tugged the hilt horizontally, first to one side, then the other,
and was rewarded by the head of the second android rolling independently across
the floor.

Where was the third? Quincy glanced wildly to each side, standing cautiously.
Nested in this machinery, against machinery, Quincy was practically blind.
Still, security androids weren't exactly renown for stealth. Perhaps they'd
miscounted?

The world went white.

Quincy lay sprawled in a daze against upturned drums, ears ringing, Grimm mask
scattered in pieces across the floor. Under their hands they felt fine,
sand-like grains. Over her towered the final security android, Quincy's orange
eyes reflected in its blank black faceplate, its rifle aimed and charging. It'd
been some time since Quincy had felt a concussive bolt. They knew at this range
that another could be lethal.

"You are trespassing on priv..."

In a sheen of arcing electricity and golden sparks, the robot came to an abrupt
and unexpected halt. Quincy let out a deep breath they hadn't realized they'd
been holding.

Aura-transfer- Quincy's semblance. Against a human, they could drain an aura
like a cold beer on a mid-summer day. Or, if needed, they could transfer some
back- so long as they were touching. Which was entirely useless against beings
without auras, such as Grimm or security androids.

Unless channeled through Dust. Through Dust, an aura acquired some of the
Dust's properties- which they'd discovered when trying to replenish their own,
only to be singed by sudden flames. Judging by the shorted-out robot standing
above them, it must be yellow Dust on which they lay. Quincy's pinkie finger
still rested against the androids cold, metal boot.

Torchwick, Cinder, and dozens of mask-clad White Fang mulled under an overcast
night sky, backgrounded by numerous Bullhead aircraft, their engines tilted and
glowing on standby. Occasionally, Torchwick or another would glance impatiently
at the Schnee processing facility's loading dock, until- with the hum of
mechanical motors and the clinking of chains- the array of bay doors all began
rising. In a door frame at the far end leaned Quincy, battered but whole.

"Well, kid" started Torchwick in his typically condescending musical tone,
"looks like you had a bit of fun while we were waiting and waiting. Take a seat
and let the grown-ups take over from here." He turned to address the others.
"Go! Remember, anything not bolted down is ours!" The mass of White Fang
hurried in unison into the building, carts in tow, trucks following closely
behind.

Quincy hissed under their breath. They didn't trust Torchwick farther than
Lacuna could strike. Why were the White Fang working with- working _for_- that
disgusting human? How did this possibly advance their cause? If Quincy's
superiors- and they still trusted them- had an explanation, they certainly
hadn't proffered it.

Quincy headed towards the loading ramp of the nearest Bullhead, stopping to
assess their reflection in the window of a Schnee cargo truck. Their usually
straight, bistre hair was matted twistedly to their olive skin. Their open,
black Zhongshan jacket and white undershirt were caked with sweat and yellow
dust, obscuring the embroidery they favored. And, of course, their Grimm mask-
the modern symbol of the White Fang- was missing, destroyed. At least Lacuna
faired well. They'd take time to clean her properly while the others worked,
lest the invasive dust cause any undesired effects.

It was some hours later when Quincy was awakened, Lacuna and a polishing cloth
in their lap, by the sound of their returning brethren. A trail of carts and
trucks carried crates of raw Dust crystals, barrels of processed Dust powder,
and a variety of unidentifiable machinery into the various Bullheads. Cinder
shouted, clearly exasperated, directing each load to its appropriate aircraft
while Torchwick paced about impatiently.

Eventually, the loading concluded and the aircraft engines began to whine,
preparing for ascent. Quincy purposely took a seat near the already-buckled
Torchwick and Cinder, hoping to assess their intentions. Afterwards, they would
wish they'd chosen any other aircraft. They didn't expect to watch Torchwick
snap his fingers, asking "Would you do the honors?", or to watch Cinder raise
her hands into the air, the Dust lines in her clothing glowing ablaze. Through
the closing cargo ramp, Quincy stared agape as the processing plant, and
everybody they had left inside, evaporated in a blinding fireball.
