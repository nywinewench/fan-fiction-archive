The guard moaned softly before collapsing onto the floor. He wasn't dead, but
when he awoke hours later, he'd have what felt like one hell of a hangover.
That's why Quincy volunteered as the "locksmith". He's one of the few who
could- and would- manage without actually killing anybody. He systematically
patted the guard's pockets until finding and swiping a security key-card.
Finally, he could let his brethren in.

Ironic, Quincy thought as he rose. A semblance that was almost useless for an
aspiring hunter against Grimm was so incredibly effective against humans.

At the nearby control terminal embedded into hallway wall, he doused the lights and
ran the key-card against the scanner. The adjacent door slid open with a quiet
_hiss_. He moved quickly, back against the entrance, tasting the air with a
long, forked tongue. His other senses more than compensated for his sub-par
night-vision (all the more obscured by his fanged, red and white Grimm mask).
Only traces of Dust and machine oil- nothing unusual for a Schnee Dust
processing plant. He rounded the door, advancing only a few feet, before...

"Halt! You are trespassing on private Schnee property! Promptly disarm and..."

Damn! Damn damn damn. Atlas security androids, their skeletal silhouettes just
visible via the faint backlight of various electronics, their smells masked by
those of the processing machinery. He couldn't wait for their monologue to
conclude- by then their guns would be raised. He drew his sword and pointed it
at the nearest android.

Lacuna- Quincy's sword, held in a wood-patterned sheath hung from his belt by
wound celadon thread. Modeled after a Han _jian_, its thin, double-edged blade
extended three feet from an ornate but diminutive guard. Its pommel was a
revolver-like barrel and hammer, capped below by ornate loops from which hung
twin celadon tassels. Against the threaded grip lay the hammer's trigger and
trigger-guard. Around the trigger, Quincy's index finger squeezed tightly.

The hammer cocked backwards, the pommel-barrel turned, and the hammer dropped.
In a heartbeat, Lacuna's blade exploded outward, extending forward in segments
across six, twelve, eighteen feet along a threaded cable. A shower of sparks
indicated that the android had been hit, but its raising rifle proved the
strike non-lethal. Quincy snapped his arm and released the trigger, and the
entire pommel mechanism spun wildly, reeling in the thin cable, reassembling
the sword segments at the hilt. More sparks flew, and the android's sawed-off
head hit the metal floor with a _thunk_, it's unfinished monologue trailing
into silence.

Then, the world went white.

Quincy lay sprawled in a daze, ears ringing, slumped against upturned drums.
Under his hands, he felt fine grains, like sand. Over him stood the security
android, his pale green eyes reflected in its cold, black faceplate, its rifle
at the ready. At this distance, another concussive bolt could be lethal.

"You are trespassing on priv..."

In a sheen of arcing electricity and orange sparks, the robot came to an
unexpected halt.

Aura-transfer- his semblance. Against a human, he could drain an aura like a
cold beer in summer. Or, if needed, he could transfer some back- so long as
they were touching. Which was entirely useless against beings without auras,
such as Grimm or security androids.

Unless channeled through Dust. Through Dust, an aura acquired some of the
Dust's properties- which he'd discovered when trying to replenish his only
to be singed by sudden flames. Judging by the shorted-out robot standing above
him, it must be yellow Dust on which he lay. His pinkie finger still rested
against it's cold, metal boot.
